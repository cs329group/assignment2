In this assignment, you are required to write a comparison tool for two versions of a Java source file. Your program takes as input two .java files representing those two versions and reports the following atomic changes:

##Contributors
* Matt McKillip
* Mason Berhenke
* Kyle Long

##Usage
TODO after I/O is done

##Test cases
We have three sets of test cases- simple, medium, and difficult. The files are contained in the /testingFiles folder.

### Easy
* basicTest1.java
* basicTest2.java

These are simple java files that we are using to test the addition and deletion of methods and fields.

### Medium
TODO once created.

### Difficult
TODO once create.d
